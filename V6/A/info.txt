106344. Hoodies

Every year student government (SG) of our university releases hoodies with KBTU print. This time they have managed to release $x$ medium size hoodies and $y$ small size hoodies only. Dozens of students demand a hoodie. Particularly, $a$ students demand a medium size hoodie, while other $b$ students demand a small size hoodie. Additionally, each of these $b$ students stated that they can wear a medium size hoodie too if no small size hoodies left.

Can SG distribute hoodies in a way such that each of these $a$ and $b$ students gets a hoodie?

In a single line given four integers $x, y, a, b$ --- the number of released medium and small size hoodies, number of students demanding for a medium and small size hoodies respectively $(1 \le x, y, a, b \le 1000)$.

If SG can manage to distribute hoodies in the desired way, print «Yes» (without quotes).
Otherwise, print «No» (without quotes).
