188624. Number of stops.

Edward decided to get a job as a conductor on a bus. The rules of the car park say that he can take a break only when all passengers have got off the bus. \\

The route is very strange, the bus starts from a bus station with $N$>4  passengers. At every even stop there are 4 people leave the bus, and at every odd stop 3 people enter. The driver misses every 7th stop because he does not like this number. \\

Edya decided to write a program that will count the number of stops he needs to drive to take a break.\\

Enter $N$ which is always > 4 and the program must count the number of stops until the bus is completely empty.


Integer $N$, where  $(4<N<=10000)$.

Integer -- the number of stops until the bus is completely empty.

If the number of people on the bus becomes negative, it is considered empty.
