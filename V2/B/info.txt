Edya recently got a job at the plant, and his monthly salary is $N$ tenge per month, but he was promised to increase it by $10\%$ every month as he is a very promising young specialist. Edya loves apple technology very much, and since a new iPhone was recently released, he immediately wanted to buy it, but it's not a task, it costs $500.000$ and since Edya doesn't like taking loans, he decided to save $30\%$ of his salary every month.
