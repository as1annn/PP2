Professor of Programming Principles always checks the presence of students using WSP. But today the WSP is down, so everyone must write his own surname at the attendance list.

But some students may have written their surname more than one times. That's why professor asked for you help. You should count the number of unique surnames in the list.

The first line of input contains a number $n$ - number of students' surnames $(1 \le n \le 10^5)$. Each of the next $n$ lines contains a students surname $s_i$ $(1 \le |s_i| \le 100)$.

Print the number of unique surnames.
